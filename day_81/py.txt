Python - General purpose programming 
-> 1991 - Guido Van Rossum 

Applications ->
Math calc 
App dev 
Web Dev 
Game dev 
ML , AI 



Statically typed vs dynamically typed -

Statically -> Data type needs to be declared  - C,C++ , Java

dynamically -> Data type need not be declared  - Python , Javascript


Compiler vs Interpreter  -> 

Compiler - code -> Byte code - machine understandable code - run  -> Fast 

Interpreter -> code - line by line - machine code - run 
-> Slow 

Output and Input 

Data types and variables ->

A name give to a memory location 

Data type -> Type of data assigned to a variable 

int  -> -100,100,1,2,5
float -> 3.14 , 10.3 
double -> 3.1429493058343094 
char -> 123,abc 1 
string -> a collection of chars enclosed within quote 
boolean -> True , False

0 , 1 - False , True 

Keywords Python -

A set of reserved words with meaning  -> Variables X 

Identifier -> Rules to write names of variables / funcs 

1. _ , letter , numbers 
2. _ , letter - start , numbers - start X 
3. no others to be used 

Comments ->  a block of lines ignored by Interpreter

#  -> Single line comment 

''' ''' ->  Multiline comment



Type casting -> Changing the data type of a variable 

# int()
# float()
# str()
# bool()

Type checking - type() 

Operators -> Symbol that performs operation 

Unary - Binary - Ternary 

Unary - single operand   -> a++ , a-- 

Binary - 2 operands -> a+b ,a-b , a&b 

Ternary - 3 operands -> a>b ? printf("Yes"):printf("No")



= , == -> 

= assignment operator   R to L  a=10
 
== equality operator  L to R a==b



Arithmetic -> +,-,*,/,// ,**,%   LtoR

**
/ * %
+ -

//floor and ceil 


Assignment -> =,+=,-=,*=,/=,//=,**=  R to L


Logical -> and , or , not    

Relational -> >,<,==,!=,>=,<=

Conditonal -> if  else   

Increment / Decrement -> ++,--  

Identity -> is , not is 

Member -> in , not in 

Bitwise -> and , or , not ,>>,<<
